Hi, I'm Jared. I'm hoping to work within my own indepent startup. I've always wanted to get into app and game development. My language of choice is C++ but I want to learn how to program in Java script. I am also and artist and a writer. I am curently working on a graphic novel. Although it is not my focus at the moment, I'm hoping invest more time into this part of my life in the future.
