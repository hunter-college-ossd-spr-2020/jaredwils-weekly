## Week one of Quarantine 
I had been monitoring the progression of COVID-19 since it’s discovery in Wuhan China, but I never realized how drastically it would change my everyday life. This is not  to say that I wasn’t taking the situation seriously. 
From the way the virus was quickly spreading and how serious some of the cases could become,  I knew that it would eventually reach the states.
I was mostly worried about how we as a community would tackle it. A week into this city wide shutdown and I think it’s safe to say “we’ve botched it”.
I mean this as no disrespect to the many doctors and emergency responders that work tirelessly through this disaster.
I just find that the way many people have reacted is less careful and more hysterical.
It’s understandable to a point. With the constant media coverage and the death toll on the rise, many people have a very valid reason to be scared.
As for the shutdown of most services including CUNY.. I agree but it has definitely been tough on me mentally.
The Classes I was taking and my daily commute into the city was a large part of my daily routine. As annoying as it could get at times, I feel as though my days are missing something. I feel less productive and drained a lot of the time. 
This new situation does have it’s slight perks. I live decently far away and my commute has always been a large time sync.  With the lack of travel, it has opened my schedule up. However, I find myself having more time, but less motivation to do anything with it.
I think I may work on  planning a daily schedule within the next week. Hopefully this will keep my mind active in the future.

## Project Progression
I’ve decided to keep my first contribution a simple one. During the end of week 6 and the beginning of week 7 I was finishing up the local development environment.
Now that I’ve completed the process I noticed that there was a slight detail left out of the instructions concerning the local environment guide.
While setting up  the developer’s environment, I was required to download two Node.js.
This software was a prerequisite that also came with npm and it’s various commands.
One challenge I faced with the npm commands a was the directory that I was required to run it from.
Many more seasoned open source programmers may see this as trivial but I found (from personal experience)  that this can cause a great bit of confusion for beginners.
Because of this I plan to add a slight edit to the local environment setup guide.
This will inform the user that it is necessary to cd within their freecodecamp director when using the npm commands.
Failure to do so causes multiple errors that are hard to debug from the messages alone.  After reading the contributing file for freecodecamp, I am unsure where this contribution should fall.
I’m assuming that it is classified as a minor documentation error rather than a major issue and thus, Should only require a pull request. 


## Other Contributions
For this week we were introduced to wikipedia contributions.
Read various articles and make two very minor contributions. 
One article was focused [animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Animation&action=history).
I had searched it up because animation is something that interests me in general.
The second article was chosen from the "Random article" tab. It was mostly done to see what came up.
However, after pulling up the article I saw a very minor change that I could make. [Rose Coombes Minshull](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rose_Coombes_Minshull&action=history)
