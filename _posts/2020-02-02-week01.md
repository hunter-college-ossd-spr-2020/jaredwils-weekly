  Honestly, When I had signed up for this class, I barely even payed attention to the name of it. The only details that I was focused on was the fact that it was a 3 credit elective class for my major, and it wasn't a class that I had taken in the past. However, after seeing what the class is all about and what it entails, I can't deny that there are parts of myself that are sorely lacking and this class can help. I still remember cringing on the first day when Professor Weiss said "blogs". I'm not the best with large scale communtiction. I personally, have always hated depending on others and working with others. It has nothing to do with the people around me, but rather with possability of my own embarrassment. I'd rather just work independently, where my mistakes are my own and (for the most part) affect only me. With that being said, I understand that this viewpoint and way of living is unrealistic and impractical. I will inevitably need to gain the skills needed to work within a group and communicate effectively. So, as unconfortable as this class may make me, I'm glad that it's giving me the ability to develop these important skills.
