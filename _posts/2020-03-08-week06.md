## Overview: Final Project Choices and More Git Basics
This week we got into groups and made out final decisions for our term projects.
My team members and I were torn between a few projects in particular but we were having some trouble
finding a  project that would work for all the members. In the end we decided on FreeCodeCamp. This is because we found 
the project to be useful and all three group members were looking to learn and contribute to a project that mostly utilized Javascript.
On Thursday, we also went over more of the basics concerning Git. Some of the things we went over had to do with Branches, merges and 
merge conflicts. Before going over merge conflicts I had trouble visualizing what would constitute as one. I'd say that this was the 
most confusing part for me. However, after covering it more in depth it became more clear to me. we also very briefly went over rebasing and
how the process differs from a merge.

## Term Project Work
I've currently looked at the local installation process for Freecodecamp and I've only been able to slightly attempt it. 
Unfortunately I first have to install some prerequisite programs that are used to run the project locally.
These applications are Docker, and Node.js. After I need to configure the development environment. 
Although I have yet to finish doing this, my experience with it and finding the instructions to do so was very simple for me.
The directions are easy to find and very thorough.

## Ouside Contributions
I added more places around food areas in my neiborhood to OpenStreetMap. 
some of the areas that I added were 

  1.[Sushi Wen](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81934308)
  
  2.[Bean and Leaves](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81935117)
  
  3.[Ho'Brah](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81935876)
  
  4.[Duffy's](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81936241)
  
 Many of these places have I've either been to or have wanted to go to and I plan onding so in the future. 
 I still need to contribute to one of my classmate blogs. I plan on making a few within the next week in addition to the 
 weekly OSM contributions.
