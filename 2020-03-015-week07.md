## Open Sourcce is Not About You: Response
After reading Open Source is Not About you, I can honestly say that I was pleasently surprised. 
It was a far stretch from the articles and informational pieces that I usually read within the classes I take.
This was a lot more opinion bases and  was a response, rather than some persuasive essay. I think the most interesting point that 
was made within Richhikry's post was the one personal resposability. I thought it was interesting how he felt that the idea of
open source had been twisted and change since it's conception and how this new idea of open source had created a sense of entitlement 
within the users and people who want to contribute. I could be wron but the way that I saw it, he was upset with the notion of an open
source project being for the community to mold and create the way they think it should be. He made it clear that no contributer should view
their contributions as a necesity. I never really thought of it this way but after thinking about it and remembering the original nature behind
open source I found myself agreeing with him. Given what open source is, if you don't like something about the project or feel like your changes 
are not being acted upon, you are allowed to take the project and make those changes yourself. However, I can imagine that there are many
contributers that believe that their changes to the project absolutely must be made.
I get how this seems unrealistic. As the author of the post explained, Him and the people payed to work on the project, have to contribute 
and make changes, as it is their jobs to do so. People who aren't, are not entitled to making changes. The project is open source and any
changes that you feel must be made, are changes that you can make on your own. It definitely seemed like a less than friendly message and it's 
something that I didn't expect to here but I can definitely understand and agree with some of the things that were expressed.

## Wikapedia contrabution research 
Unfortunately, as a result of me being behind, I was unable to find any posts that I could really start to contribute to. I was however able to
read the the resources the at were offered on contributing and what goes into that. One point that I will have to observe when contributing in the future
is keeping an unbiased viewpoint. 

## Project Progress 
Completed: Chose Freecodecamp
Completed: setup Development environment
In Progress: looked into possible issues to cover

  1.[issue 1](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38380)
  This is a very simple bug that will most likely be completed by the time I get to it but could be used as good practice anyway.
  
  2.[issue 2](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38312)
  issue has been done already but can use as practice issue.
  
In Progress: Testing out some test changes within my local copy

In Progress: Learning Javascript 

Not started: for practice try fixing a previously fixed issue on my local machine

Not started: Check out a specific issue

Not started: Work on issue

Not started: Make contribution


## Other Contrabutions 
I added two more places to the openstreetmMap, [Blue](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/82234095), and
